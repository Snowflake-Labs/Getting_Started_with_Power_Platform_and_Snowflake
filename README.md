Overview
Join Snowflake and Microsoft for an quickstart to build a PowerApps App that can access retail customer data as virtual table, do a writeback, trigger a segmentation flow using PowerAutomate without making a copy of the data. We will use the PowerApps connector from Microsoft premium connectors marketplace, which is a wrapper around the Snowflake SQL API that allows you to read and write data to Snowflake databases, and execute any stored procedures.
